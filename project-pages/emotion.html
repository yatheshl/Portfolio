          <div class="body-text">This project focuses on developing a facial emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is capable of detecting and classifying human emotions in real-time through facial expressions. It is built using Python, with Keras and TensorFlow as the primary libraries. The model is trained and validated on the FER2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 grayscale images of faces, each labeled with one of seven emotions.</div>

          <div class="body-text"><b>Dataset:</b> Utilized the FER2013 dataset, which consists of 35,887 grayscale images of faces, each labeled with one of seven emotions (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral).</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Model Architecture:</b>

            Designed a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
            Employed batch normalization and dropout techniques to prevent overfitting.
            Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
            Achieved competitive performance on the validation set, with potential for further optimization.</div>
