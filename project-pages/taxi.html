          <div class="body-text">In this project, I created an AI agent to solve the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent's goal is to pick up a passenger at a certain location and drop them off at another location in the shortest amount of time. The agent uses Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn the optimal actions to take in each state and reduce the number of steps taken to complete the task.</div>

          <div class="body-text">The AI agent was trained over 50,000 episodes and tested on 100 episodes. The average score over the test episodes was calculated to measure the agent's performance. The agent successfully learned to complete the task efficiently, showcasing the effectiveness of Q-learning in solving reinforcement learning problems.</div>
