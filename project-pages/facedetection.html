          <div class="body-text">This project presents a real-time face recognition and identification system using OpenCV, face_recognition library, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The system is designed to recognize and identify known individuals from a video stream, displaying their names and the confidence level of the recognition.</div>

          <div class="body-text"><b>Key Features:</b></div>
          <ul>
            <li class="body-text"><b>Preprocessing and Encoding of Known Faces:</b> The system preprocesses a set of known face images stored in the known_faces directory, generating face encodings for each person. The face encodings are then averaged to create a single representation for each individual.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="body-text"><b>Training an SVM Classifier:</b> A linear SVM classifier is trained using the face encodings as input features and the names of the individuals as target labels. This classifier is responsible for predicting the identity of a person from their face encoding.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="body-text"><b>Real-Time Face Recognition:</b> The system captures video frames using OpenCV's VideoCapture object, resizing and converting them to the appropriate color space. Face locations are detected using the face_recognition library, and encodings are generated for each detected face.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="body-text"><b>Identification and Confidence Level Estimation:</b> The SVM classifier predicts the identity of each detected face, along with the corresponding confidence level (probability). The system displays the recognized individual's name and confidence level as an overlay on the video frame.</li>
            <br>
            <li class="body-text"><b>Display and User Interaction:</b> The video stream, along with the recognition and identification results, is displayed in real-time using OpenCV's imshow function. The system allows the user to stop the video stream by pressing the 'q' key.</li>
